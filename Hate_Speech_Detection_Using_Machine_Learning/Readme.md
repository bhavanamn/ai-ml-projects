# 🗣️ Hate Speech Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project designed to **detect hate speech** in text data using multiple classification algorithms. The project leverages **traditional ML models** along with vectorization techniques to classify text as hate speech or not.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

The project uses several machine learning algorithms for text classification

1. **Decision Tree** – Captures non-linear relationships between text features.  
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Classifies based on similarity with training samples.  
3. **Logistic Regression** – Linear classifier suitable for binary classification.  
4. **Naive Bayes** – Probabilistic classifier, effective for text data.  
5. **Random Forest** – Ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## 🛠️ Features & Vectorization

- **Count Vectorizer** – Converts text into a bag-of-words model.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** – Weighs words based on importance across documents.  

These vectorized features are fed into the classifiers for training and prediction.
