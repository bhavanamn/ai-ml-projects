BARC Theatre of War

A virtual simulation environment designed to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This platform allows users to train, test, and evaluate agents based on Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in a safe, cost-effective, and fully customizable environment.

🌟 Key Features

Entity Types: Security Forces, Common Public, Attackers

Modular & Adaptive: Customizable environments, scenarios, and threat levels

Scenario Simulation: Supports multiple, repeatable training scenarios

Safe & Cost-Efficient: No physical damage; reduces expenses compared to real-world drills

Dynamic Interaction: Agents learn complex behaviors in a realistic virtual world

🎯 Advantages
Advantage	Description
Adaptive Scene	Environment dynamically adjusts for different situations
Multiple Scenarios	Train agents across various scenarios and threat levels
No Physical Damage	Safe, risk-free training for personnel and property
Cost Efficient	Eliminates the need for expensive real-world exercises
